The show revolves around the Belcher family, who run a hamburger restaurant called \"Bob\\'s Burgers\" in the fictional beach town of Ocean Bay, New Jersey.\\n\\nThe main character, Bob Belcher (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin), is the patriarch of the family and the owner of the restaurant. He is a well-meaning but slightly awkward burger enthusiast who often comes up with creative burger names to attract customers. His wife, Linda (voiced by John Roberts), is the voice of reason in the family and manages the restaurant\\'s front-of-house operations.\\n\\nThe Belchers have three children: Tina (voiced by Dan Mintz), a socially awkward teenager; Gene (voiced by Eugene Mirman), the middle child who is often depicted as awkward and insecure; and Louise (voiced by Kristen Schaal), the youngest and most mischievous of the siblings. Each character has their own unique personality, quirks, and storylines throughout the series.\\n\\nThroughout its run, \"Bob\\'s Burgers\" has developed a cult following for its offbeat humor, relatable characters, and quirky storytelling. The show has received critical acclaim and has been praised for its satire of small-town life, family dynamics, and social issues.\\n\\nThe show also features a cast of recurring and guest characters, including Jimmy Pesto (voiced by Patton Oswalt), the owner of a rival burger joint; Teddy (voiced by Larry Murphy), Bob\\'s friend and frequent customer; and Hugo Habercore (voiced by Andy Kindler), the eccentric health inspector who often clashes with Bob.\\n\\nOverall, \"Bob\\'s Burgers\" is a heartwarming and hilarious animated series that explores the ups and downs of family life, entrepreneurship, and small-town politics.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 43406974963, 'load_duration': 32396441, 'prompt_eval_count': 31, 'prompt_eval_duration': 119000000, 'eval_count': 378, 'eval_duration': 43254000000}\n"
